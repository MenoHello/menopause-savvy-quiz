      {
        category: "Hormonal Health",
        question: "Can your estrogen levels start to fluctuate years before your period actually stops?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Perimenopause often begins in your 40s, but some women notice symptoms as early as their mid-30s. Estrogen doesn't gradually taper off—it fluctuates unpredictably, triggering symptoms long before menstruation ends."
      },
      {
        category: "Sleep & Fatigue",
        question: "What causes sudden insomnia during perimenopause?",
        type: "multiple",
        options: [
          "A drop in estrogen and progesterone",
          "Caffeine consumption only",
          "Aging in general",
          "Too much screen time before bed"
        ],
        correct: "A drop in estrogen and progesterone",
        explanation: "Fluctuating hormones—especially estrogen and progesterone—interfere with melatonin production and your body’s ability to regulate temperature. These disruptions are a major cause of new or worsening insomnia during perimenopause."
      },
      {
        category: "Emotional Wellbeing",
        question: "Can sudden bouts of anxiety or rage be linked to perimenopause?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Estrogen helps regulate mood by influencing serotonin, dopamine, and other brain chemicals. During perimenopause, extreme hormonal fluctuations can trigger intense emotional responses, including panic, anger, or weepiness, seemingly out of nowhere."
