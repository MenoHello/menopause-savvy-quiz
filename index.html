    const quizData = [
      {
        category: "Hormonal Health",
        question: "Can your estrogen levels start to fluctuate years before your period actually stops?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Perimenopause often begins in your 40s, but some women notice symptoms as early as their mid-30s. Estrogen doesn't gradually taper off—it fluctuates unpredictably, triggering symptoms long before menstruation ends."
      },
      {
        category: "Sleep & Fatigue",
        question: "What causes sudden insomnia during perimenopause?",
        type: "multiple",
        options: [
          "A drop in estrogen and progesterone",
          "Caffeine consumption only",
          "Aging in general",
          "Too much screen time before bed"
        ],
        correct: "A drop in estrogen and progesterone",
        explanation: "Fluctuating hormones—especially estrogen and progesterone—interfere with melatonin production and your body’s ability to regulate temperature. These disruptions are a major cause of new or worsening insomnia during perimenopause."
      },
      {
        category: "Emotional Wellbeing",
        question: "Can sudden bouts of anxiety or rage be linked to perimenopause?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Estrogen helps regulate mood by influencing serotonin, dopamine, and other brain chemicals. During perimenopause, extreme hormonal fluctuations can trigger intense emotional responses, including panic, anger, or weepiness, seemingly out of nowhere."
      },
      {
        category: "Joint & Muscle Pain",
        question: "Could frozen shoulder or hip pain in your 40s be related to perimenopause?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Estrogen plays a key role in keeping joints flexible and reducing inflammation. Its decline can contribute to conditions like adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) and unexplained hip or pelvic pain—especially in women in their 40s."
      },
      {
        category: "Lesser-Known Symptoms",
        question: "What causes some women to experience crawling skin sensations (formication) during peri/menopause?",
        type: "multiple",
        options: [
          "Allergic reactions",
          "Anxiety",
          "Estrogen affecting nerve endings",
          "Skin infections"
        ],
        correct: "Estrogen affecting nerve endings",
        explanation: "Formication is the feeling of bugs crawling on your skin—often with no visible cause. It’s linked to declining estrogen, which can cause nerves in the skin to misfire, especially during perimenopause or menopause."
      },
      {
        category: "Temperature Regulation",
        question: "Do hot flashes only happen during the day?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "No",
        explanation: "Night sweats are nocturnal hot flashes caused by hormone-triggered misfires in the hypothalamus, your body’s thermostat. These episodes can soak your sheets and disrupt your sleep multiple times a night."
      },
      {
        category: "Skin, Hair & Nails",
        question: "What causes dry skin, thinning hair, and brittle nails during menopause?",
        type: "multiple",
        options: [
          "Changing digestion",
          "Lack of sleep",
          "Changing eating habits",
          "Declining estrogen levels"
        ],
        correct: "Declining estrogen levels",
        explanation: "Estrogen supports collagen, sebum production, and circulation. When it drops, skin becomes drier and thinner, hair growth slows, and nails can become brittle and weak—even without any change to your routine."
      },
      {
        category: "Mental Health",
        question: "Are anxiety or mood swings more common in perimenopause than in menopause?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Perimenopause is a hormonal rollercoaster. Estrogen and progesterone levels swing wildly, which can destabilize your mood, increase anxiety, and lower your emotional resilience—even if you've never had mental health issues before."
      },
      {
        category: "Vaginal & Urinary Health",
        question: "What causes more frequent UTIs during menopause?",
        type: "multiple",
        options: [
          "Not drinking enough water",
          "Declining estrogen levels",
          "Poor hygiene",
          "New sexual partners"
        ],
        correct: "Declining estrogen levels",
        explanation: "Estrogen helps maintain the thickness and pH balance of the vaginal and urinary tract lining. When levels fall, these tissues become more fragile, making it easier for bacteria to cause infection—even without any changes in hygiene or habits."
      },
      {
        category: "Cognitive & Sensory Health",
        question: "Can menopause impact your sense of smell or hearing?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Estrogen influences how your brain and nerves process sensory input. As it declines, you may become sensitive to sound, struggle with muffled hearing, or notice subtle changes in how things smell—without any clear medical explanation."
      },
      {
        category: "Gut Health",
        question: "Can menopause affect digestion or cause bloating?",
        type: "boolean",
        correct: "Yes",
        explanation: "Estrogen helps regulate gut motility and supports a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Hormonal shifts during perimenopause can slow digestion, increase bloating, and even trigger new food sensitivities—like dairy or gluten intolerance."
